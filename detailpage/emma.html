    <p class="session-synopsis">
        <Strong>Synopsis: </Strong>
        Data-driven performance management is mainly a strategic approach to leveraging data analytics and insights to monitor, evaluate, and improve asset performance in the energy industry. It involves collecting and analyzing data related to the activities, achievements, and outputs of an asset to make informed decision about performance. Data sources may include productivity metrics, sales figures, project completion rates, and other relevant performance indicators.
Following collection, data is analyzed to find trends, patterns, and opportunities for development. Advanced data analytic techniques, such as predictive modeling and machine learning algorithms are employed to derive actionable insights from the data. These insights support managers and experts in the energy sector in locating high-performing assets, pinpointing performance gaps, and efficiently allocating resources. 
With data-driven performance management, managers and executives in the energy industry can receive ongoing feedback that highlights the asset's areas of strength and improvement based on current performance data. By leveraging data-driven performance management, energy leaders can be empowered to optimize asset performance and drive organizational success.
This session aims to explain what data-driven performance management is, and the key role it is expected to play in the performance and efficiency of energy leaders.
