    <p class="session-synopsis">
        <Strong>Synopsis: </Strong>
        To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the science is clear that emissions need to be reduced by almost half 
        by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. However, meeting the global GHG emission reduction levels and achieving the net 
        zero target by 2050 dictated by the Paris Agreement will demand long-lasting solutions and comprehensive climate action strategies. 
        Today, energy is responsible for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions. Oil (32%), natural gas (21%) and coal 
        (29%) together make up 82% of the world’s energy mix, according to the IEA. The remaining fifth comes from biomass, 
        waste, hydropower, nuclear, and other renewables (such as solar and wind). Achieving a net zero world will require 
        ending reliance on fossil fuels and investing in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, 
        sustainable, and reliable. Even though achieving this goal is challenging, it remains the only real solution to combat 
        climate change and preserve the planet for future generations. Thus, a transformation of the global energy system is 
        required to avoid the serious consequences of climate change and at the same time address the rising demand for global energy.
        This break-out session aims to discuss why net zero is important and how it can be achieved. The session will also highlight 
        the need to ensure that global commitments and net zero pledges are turned into action.
