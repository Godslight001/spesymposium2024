            <strong>Course Overview: </strong>
            Project management and business analysis are two disciplines that are becoming more strategic for 
            companies in the energy industry. While Project management focuses on the creation of the “product, 
            service, or result” of the project in order to meet its objectives, business analysis aims at understanding 
            the needs of the business, the cost involved, the market, the stakeholders and defining the characteristics 
            of the solution to meeting those needs. The integration of these two disciplines can propel the energy 
            industry towards achieving best project performance, in achieving project objectives and creating business value.
            The course objectives include:
