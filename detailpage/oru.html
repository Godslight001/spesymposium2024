    <h3 class="session-title">Integrated Well, Reservoir,
        and Facility Management in the 
        Energy Sector</h3>
    <p class="session-synopsis">
        <strong>Course Overview: </strong>
        Ren Datasim (RDS) has formed by a group of Chevron retirees in Houston, US, since 2021. Currently, RDS is working 
        with First Genesis (FG) in Houston, US, which made it possible using Oil/Gas Production and Process Operation Digital 
        Twin (DT) technology combined with actor model and blockchain data distribution and data fabric technology on Xenese platform. 
        This innovation provides a real-time digital representation of physical systems, fluid produced, and their associated 
        production workflow, which is combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) models to enable predictive 
        analytics and prescriptive insights.
        Actor models can provide distributed control and coordination across multiple platforms, such as cloud, edge, and IoT, 
        and can link to existing systems and processes to enable automated operation workflow and data analysis.
        By leveraging the capabilities of a digital twin technology with actor models built on the blockchain Xenese platform to 
        create an exact virtual representation of an oil and gas production facility operations and workflows. The operators can 
        gain the ability to better monitor, predict, and optimize their operations. This could result in significant cost savings, 
        improved safety, and overall efficiency benefits for each functional sector, including interactive coordinates.
        As summary, the digital twin solution combined with actor models built on the blockchain Xenese platform, is combining the 
        oil/gas modelling technologies, actor model interface management advantages, and blockchain distributed data management all 
        together, and allow the digital twin could be scalable, not losing any rigorous behaviour analysis, and enable to have a various 
        accurate digital virtual representation for a very large facility including a lot of detailed edge systems in real time.

                Tamunomiete Oruambo ('Miete) is an energy professional with a blend of training and experiences in petroleum engineering, geosciences and human resource management with Shell Nigeria and has been with the company since 2015. 

Miete has a background in physics from Rivers State University and an MSc in exploration geophysics from The University of Leeds, UK. His professional experience spans across the end to end value chain for Wells, Reservoir and Facility Management (WRFM) - ranging from reservoir management and front-end design for production restoration & optimization, to integrated execution planning and operations management, all geared towards maximizing asset value. Miete has a passion for continuous improvement and technical excellence and currently works as a Project Delivery Adviser for WRFM in Shell Nigeria. <br><br>

Outside of work, Miete likes to unwind with interesting TV series/movies, occasionally watch football and also enjoys competitive games. He is happily married to Mrs. Victoria Tamunomiete-Oruambo and they are blessed with a son.
